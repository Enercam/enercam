    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about Enercam solar roofs.",
    "items": {
      "0": {
        "question": "Are your solar roofs suitable for African climates?",
        "answer": "Yes, they are. Africa has some of the highest solar irradiation levels in the world. Our solar roofs perform exceptionally well in hot, sunny climates and are designed to withstand heat, humidity, and strong winds."
      },
      "1": {
        "question": "Can your solar roofs reduce my dependence on unreliable grid power?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Our solar roofs help households and businesses reduce outages caused by unstable grids. When paired with a battery system, they can provide continuous electricity even during blackouts."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "Do your solar roofs work during the rainy season?",
        "answer": "Yes. Even during cloudy or rainy periods, our solar roofs still produce electricity—though at a slightly reduced output. Battery storage helps bridge low-sunlight days."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "How durable are your solar roofs in high heat or harsh weather?",
        "answer": "Our solar roofs are engineered to operate efficiently in high temperatures and withstand storms, heavy rains, and high winds common in many African regions."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "What maintenance is required in dusty or sandy areas?",
        "answer": "In regions with dust or harmattan winds, our solar roofs may need more frequent cleaning. A simple rinse every few weeks ensures maximum performance."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "Will your solar roof power essential loads during outages?",
        "answer": "Yes. When combined with the right storage batteries, our solar roofs can power TV, lights, fridges, fans, routers, and other essential appliances during grid failures or fuel shortages."
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "Can your solar roofs help me save on petrol/diesel generator costs?",
        "answer": "Yes. Many African homes and businesses rely on expensive petrol/diesel generators. Our solar roof reduces fuel usage, noise, and maintenance costs significantly."
      },
      "7": {
        "question": "Can you switch my existing roof to a solar roof?",
        "answer": "No matter your roof, we could convert it into a solar roof through retro-fitting or completely re-installing a new, customizable solar roof."
      },
      "8": {
        "question": "How long will a solar roof last in African conditions?",
        "answer": "Solar panels typically last 25–30 years. High-quality mounting hardware also resists rust and corrosion, even in coastal areas like West or East Africa."
      },
      "9": {
        "question": "Can rural homes benefit from your solar roof?",
        "answer": "Yes. In off-grid or under-electrified areas, solar roofs provide reliable power without depending on the national grid. They are often the most cost-effective solution."
      },
      "10": {
        "question": "Are your solar roofs affordable?",
        "answer": "Our prices have dropped significantly. We also offer flexible payment options, financing plans, or phased upgrades to make solar more accessible."
