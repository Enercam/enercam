Application/Project



























Roofit steel roof







Discover the Power of Metal Solar Roofs



            
100% weatherproof
Our solar roof is more than just a roof. It’s a powerhouse designed to withstand any weather condition, including snow, ice, hail, and wind. The solar modules are weatherproof, thanks to our tried-and-tested traditional seaming technology and a robust metal back-sheet.

2-in-1 Solar Powered Roofing Material
Combining roof and traditional solar panels into one product (2-in-1) reduces material and labor costs for both manufacturing and installation.

25-Year Warranty
If our product is not consistent during the warranty period, we will either repair or replace it, or we will refund the purchase price.

Maintenance free
Integrated solar roofs are maintenance- free because they replace traditional roof covering, eliminating the need for maintenance like removing snow, ice or tree leaves that tend to accumulate under conventional solar panels. What’s more, since integrated solar roofs don’t have bolts, they don’t require regular fastener inspections.


360° protection
Our integrated solar panels offer more than just protection from rising electricity prices. With all electrical wires and connectors safely secured under the steel roof, our solution ensures increased durability and significantly lowers the risk of short circuits due to weather damage.

The strength of steel and the power of the sun
Steel is an extremely strong and durable material that has been used on roofs for centuries. Metal roof is long-lasting and can withstand different weather conditions well. Our solar metal roofs can last for decades.

Project Case Studies 

2 kW SOLAR ROOF INSTALLATION, DOUALA, CAMEROON 
Our recent 2 kW solar roof project in Douala, Cameroon stands as a strong example of our commitment to sustainable energy solutions, high-quality workmanship, and customer-focused service. Located in one of Central Africa’s fastest-growing urban centers, the project aimed to provide reliable, clean energy to support both daily household needs and long-term energy stability for our client.










From the initial assessment to final commissioning, the installation was carried out with professionalism, transparency, and a deep respect for the client’s expectations. The rooftop system was designed to optimize Douala’s abundant sunlight, ensuring consistent energy production despite the region’s humid tropical climate. Our engineering team conducted a thorough structural and electrical evaluation to ensure safe mounting, efficient cable routing, and seamless integration with the existing power supply.






















The project was completed on schedule, with all safety and quality protocols strictly followed. We also provided practical guidance on system monitoring and maintenance, empowering the client to maximize the lifetime performance of their solar investment. The immediate reduction in electricity costs and dependence on grid power has already brought significant value to the homeowner, particularly in an area where power interruptions are common.
What made this project truly rewarding was the collaborative spirit shared between our team and the client. Their openness, trust, and enthusiasm for renewable energy made every stage smooth and enjoyable. We are proud to have delivered a system that not only performs reliably but also contributes positively to the environment and the future energy landscape of Cameroon.
This 2-kW solar installation is more than just a technical achievement—it is a reflection of our dedication to building long-term relationships, supporting clean energy adoption, and improving lives through dependable and innovative roofing and solar solutions. We look forward to continuing to serve the Douala community and many more clients across the region with the same passion, integrity, and excellence.

2. Can your solar roofs reduce my dependence on unreliable grid power?
Absolutely. Our solar roofs help households and businesses reduce outages caused by unstable grids. When paired with a battery system, they can provide continuous electricity even during blackouts.
3. Do your solar roofs work during the rainy season?
Yes. Even during cloudy or rainy periods, our solar roofs still produce electricity—though at a slightly reduced output. Battery storage helps bridge low-sunlight days.
4. How durable are your solar roofs in high heat or harsh weather?
Our solar roofs are engineered to operate efficiently in high temperatures and withstand storms, heavy rains, and high winds common in many African regions.
5. What maintenance is required in dusty or sandy areas?
In regions with dust or harmattan winds, our solar roofs may need more frequent cleaning. A simple rinse every few weeks ensures maximum performance.
6. Will your solar roof power essential loads during outages?
Yes. When combined with the right storage batteries, our solar roofs can power TV, lights, fridges, fans, routers, and other essential appliances during grid failures or fuel shortages.
